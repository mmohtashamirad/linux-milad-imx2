FlexTimer Quadrature decoder counter

This driver exposes a simple counter for the quadrature decoder mode.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "fsl,ftm-quaddec".
- reg:			Must be set to the memory region of the flextimer.
- clocks:		Must be set to the root clk of the FlexTimer device
- clock-name:		Must be set to "ipg"

Optional property:
- big-endian:		Access the device registers in big-endian mode.

Example:
		counter1: counter@30640000 {
			compatible = "fsl,ftm-quaddec";
			reg = <0x30640000 0x10000>;
			clocks = <&clks IMX7D_FLEXTIMER1_ROOT_CLK>;
			clock-names = "ipg";
			big-endian;
			status = "disabled";
		};
